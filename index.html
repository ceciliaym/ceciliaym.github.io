         <p> Hello everyone! I go by Ceci for short. I was born in 1993 in Georgia.
             My father was in the military, so I moved around alot as a child. I call Virginia
             my home, becuase I have been here for the past 13 years! For the past three years I 
             have been managing my own small cleaning buiness. I'm so greatful for what I have acheved
             at such a young ago, but like a normal human being...I'm never satified.
         </p>
         <p>
             I had always had an intense interest in learning how to create websites, but 
             never thought I could possible ever learn. As I have learned in life...anything is possible!
             I hope to soon open up a small business helping individuals/businesses with their websites.
         </p>
